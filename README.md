# Variables

After this task, you should be able to understand what are variables, constants, and string interpolation.

## Instructions

- Fork, and clone this repo to your development folder. 
- Double click on index.html, and open the website using Chrome
- After every edit, save, go to the browser, and refresh the page
- Only edit `index.js` file, don't touch any other files
- ðŸ”´ DON'T MAKE ANY CHANGES ON `index.html`, we're teaching you how to change the variables not HTML.

### 1. Variable / constant creation 
- In `index.js` you should define the following variables with the exact names 
1. `fullName`      -> assign it a value of your full name
2. `yearOfBirth`   -> assign it a value of your year of birth
3. `hobby`         -> assign it a value of your favorite hobby
4. `funFact`       -> assign it a value of some fun fact about yourself 
5. `image`         -> assign it a value of a url of your image or any image that represents you online


 
This how it should look like

### 2. Mutate the variables

Variables are made to be mutated, which means it can be changed. Notice that we're just printing values "Playing Chess", "1987", ..., let's make it more representive by modifying the variables and add some descriptions on them
1. `fullName`      -> change it to: `My name is {YOUR_NAME}`
2. `yearOfBirth`   -> change it to: `I am {Years old}`, and make sure you calculate your age from your year of birth
3. `hobby`         -> change it to: `My hobby is {YOUR_HOBBY}`
