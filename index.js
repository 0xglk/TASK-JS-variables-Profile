 * You are asked to create new variables and concatenate the variables you just defined to make them as follows
 * You must use string interpolation -> `${}`
 *
 1. fullNameString      -> assign it to: My name is {fullName}
 2. yearOfBirthString   -> assign it to: I am {YOUR_AGE}, and make sure you calculate your age from your year of birth
 3. hobbyString         -> assign it to: My hobby is {YOUR_HOBBY}
